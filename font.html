    <h1 style="font-family:pacifico;">Thirsty Crow</h1>
    <p style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">On a very hot summer day in the fields, a thirsty crow flew everywhere in search of water. Suddenly, his gaze landed on a pitcher on the ground with little water in it. The water level was too low, and the pitcher had a narrow neck, because of which the crow could not drink the water.

        Then an idea came to him. He started picking the pebbles scattered near the pitcher and dropping them into it one by one. As pebbles went into the pitcher, the water rose. The crow drank the water and thanked mother nature.
        
        Moral Of The Story
        “Where there is a will, there is a way!”
        
        By reading this short story, the moral we learn is that by thinking and working hard, we may find the solution to any difficult problem. If we have willingness and determination, anything can be achieved. The crow used his patience and intelligence to put stones into the pitcher so water could get out. He did not lose hope, and with persistence (dropping pebbles one by one), he drank water and saved his life.
        
        We must teach children that in any adverse situation, the most important thing is to keep patience, observe the situation, and then find a solution with the available resources.
        
        How Can Children Apply The Moral In Their Real Life?
        The story with pictures sets a perfect example of smart work and determination. The crow in the story did not give up despite being weak. He made the outcomes favourable for him by making use of little pebbles. Just like the crow, we can make our life successful by taking opportunities and being grateful for them.
        
        The story also teaches children about water displacement inventions and scientific theories. You can ask your little one to do a similar experiment with pebbles in a small water tub and see how they react by becoming the crow of the story!</p>
